# Smoking_Cessation_Training
Training Model - Smoking Cessation

This is the first training model using Wang Zhao's excellent ASDM framework https://github.com/wzh1895/ASDM to get people used to coding SD models in Python.

The example is purely illustrative but demonstrates the general flow of such models. 

It can be installed by creating a python virtual environment and then calling:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

He has tested it in Linux using python 3.8 and I used python 3.10 in windows - both seemed to work. As we go we will add unit tests to make it more robust.

You will need to obtain the ASDM engine components either from Zhao's repo or use the ones contained in this repository for it to work. 

The final model behaves as per the image below: (Image taken from Stella version)
